# There's 4 default item: blacklist, whitelist, enable, disable.
# you can't create more because they connect to the code.
#
# model-id is CustomModelData, use for TexturePack, you can leave it 0

# Because of whitelist and blacklist (also with enable and disable) will not appear together,
# so you should put them both in 1 single slot.
# Also, blacklist and whitelist will override other items,
# so you don't need to worry about set them on others items' slot.
